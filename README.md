# Google_Teachable_Machine_Radiography_Problem

In this tutorial, I have solved a problem of supervised learning classification on an image dataset to recognize the disease from X-ray images. The motivation behind this is learn already available technologies and how artificial intelligence solves computer vision problems. I have also exported both models (binary class and multi-class) to use for further processes and share on some online repositories. These models also help the radiographers to access the X-ray images to identify the disease, especially during the overwhelming situation in hospitals like COVID-19.

This work does not belong to any specific task from school or company. This work aims to learn machine learning from already developed systems.

Thanks.
