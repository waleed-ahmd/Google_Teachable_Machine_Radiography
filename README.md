# Resource_mng-Health-Care
This repository contains an ML-based model for resource management in health care, especially in the overwhelming patient COVID-19 situation.

I am also going to attach complete documents that will answer like:
1. Why I have implemented this solution?
2. Who will be the users of the proposed work?
3. How we could utilize the ML and Data Mining techniques to solve such issues.
4. How we utilize the dataset to solve the underlying problem.


Additionally, I also have uploaded the datasets (Training and Testing) being employed for this work. This is the publically available dataset. 



I uploaded the training data file after compressing it because it is more than 25MB. GitHub free version might not support files over 25MBs.

This work does not belong to any specific task from school or company. The purpose of this work is just to understand how to work with data and solve some real-world problems.

Thanks.
